    <p><strong>1. Fake News Detection :</strong>  <br>
To develop a model which detect and classifies the fake and real news, which is a classic text classification issue.Machine Learning Models Used are Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest and KNN.TF-IDF vectorizer is used for feature extraction and tested the efficiency of the classifier using accuracy. The Accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score of every model is compared, Logistic regression is selected as the best model. With an accuracy of 90.5%.</p>
<p><strong>2. Chatbot for rubber department:</strong>   <br>
The chatbot is developed  for the rubber board of Kerala,Various machine
learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques are used to generate and process
the response. A JSON file is created which is trained and fits into the model which is later on
used for prediction. The aim is to provide a response similar to the one provided by humans in
person.A sequential model was used for the development of the model. A response is generated based on the user input combining both rule-based and self-learned. It also provides information extracted from Google after scraping and weather forecast report of a specific location.</p>
<p><strong>3. AI Chatbot:</strong>   <br>
When it comes to creating chatbots, there are various options available, including Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, Amazon Lex, and Rasa. Among these, Rasa is a preferred choice as it uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to build chatbots that can understand user input and respond in a relevant manner. To develop a chatbot using Rasa, several steps need to be followed, including outlining the domain, generating training data, teaching the machine learning model, and distributing the chatbot on various messaging platforms. Rasa&rsquo;s open-source platform also provides advanced features like customized actions, entity detection, and machine learning pipelines that enable the creation of more sophisticated chatbots with a natural and engaging conversational interface.</p>
